// Compilation and Execution process of JAVA in 4 simple step

// step 1: First we make a java file with extension .java (lets say its name is java), it is also called source code
// step 2:we give our first.java to java compiler
// step 3:java compiler compiles .java file and make it .class file or byte code which provides us security and only jvm(java virtual machine can understand it) , its size is of 8 bits
// step 4:Now we give our byte code to JVM and JVM gives us Output
